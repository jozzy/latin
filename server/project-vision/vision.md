Latin: A New Language for Human-Readable Programs

"What if building logic was as natural as writing a sentence?"
Latin is a new kind of programming language ‚Äî designed to bring the power of automation and computation to everyone, through natural language, but with the rigor, modularity, and testability that made traditional programming so successful.
üåç Vision

We are reimagining the act of programming itself ‚Äî not as code for machines, but as expressions of human logic rendered in structured natural language.

Latin is not a wrapper over code.
It‚Äôs a semantic programming language, where prompts are programs, modules are ideas, and language is the interface.

Our belief:

Prompting is the new programming.
Programs should be testable ideas, not opaque scripts.
Business users should be able to write logic, without engineers becoming bottlenecks.
The first principles of software engineering ‚Äî modularity, reuse, composability, testing ‚Äî should still apply.
üß± First Principles

Programs must be modular

From UNIX pipes to object-oriented methods ‚Äî modularity is how we scaled complexity.
In Latin, every .latin file is a unit ‚Äî a testable, composable, expressive logic block.
Programs must be versioned and testable

Just like Git made code safe to evolve, Latin supports semantic versioning and A/B testing natively.
You can write multiple versions of a logic block and route intelligently between them.
Programs must be expressive, yet deterministic

Unlike opaque prompts, Latin logic is structured and interpretable.
Logic is declared in Markdown-like syntax with metadata, variants, and expected behavior.
Programs must be deployable

From the early days of Fortran to Docker ‚Äî code that can't run is code that doesn't matter.
Latin programs are deployed instantly as APIs using ARC ‚Äî our Kotlin-based semantic runtime.
üß† Why a New Language?

Just as:

COBOL brought business logic to non-engineers,
Python democratized scripting and automation,
SQL allowed declarative data access without imperative programming...
Latin is built to:

Express business logic, workflows, and reasoning
Allow non-programmers to think programmatically
Build resilient automations using text as code
üìú Philosophical Roots

LISP: Programs as data (code-as-data). Latin treats language blocks as inspectable objects.
Smalltalk: Simplicity, objects, and exploratory programming. Latin IDE enables conversational debugging.
Unix: Do one thing well. Latin modules can be tested and composed like shell utilities.
HyperTalk: Natural-language coding for early Mac systems ‚Äî expressive, human-friendly logic.
React: Component modularity. Latin logic blocks are like reusable UI components for behavior.
üî¨ Deep Historical Parallels

Era	Breakthrough	What Latin Inherits
1950s	FORTRAN ‚Äì abstraction from hardware	Focus on idea, not system
1970s	Unix + Pipes ‚Äì composition	Modular .latin programs
1980s	LISP/Scheme ‚Äì code is data	Every Latin block is introspectable
1990s	HTML + CSS ‚Äì declarative markup	Markdown as a semantic shell
2000s	Rails ‚Äì convention over config	Templates, runtime defaults
2010s	React ‚Äì component thinking	Prompt modules as components
2020s	LLMs ‚Äì prompts as programs	Prompts as first-class citizens
üîÅ Latin + Latin Runtime

Latin defines the logic.
Latin (Latin Runtime Container) runs it.

ARC:

Is a Spring Boot-based runtime engine (Kotlin)
Exposes each module as a RESTful endpoint
Handles memory, routing, state, and A/B versioning
Supports hot reloading, sandbox testing, and long-running workflows
üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Build

Customer service bots with voice/email/chat logic
Device-monitoring workflows that send proactive alerts
Smart assistants that explain, summarize, and guide
Internal tools that simulate expert workflows (legal, billing, operations)
‚ú® A Glimpse of Latin

### UseCase: account_setup
#### Description:
New customer needs help setting up their account over phone.

#### Voice Behavior:
- Welcome them
- Confirm steps
- Ask before proceeding

#### Logic:
Welcome to our service! I'm excited to help you get set up today...
This runs at: POST /latin/account_setup ‚Ä¶and behaves as expected ‚Äî across chat, voice, or email, depending on the variant.

üî≠ Where We're Headed

A rich type system for logic flows User-facing IDEs with visual diffing, testing, and simulation Runtime observability and semantic tracing Native integrations with voice, chat, email, APIs Open template ecosystem for business domains üìñ Who This Is For

Builders of the next wave of automation Domain experts who know what should happen, but not how to code it AI teams who want testable, explainable prompting infrastructure Thinkers who believe software should speak human üß¨ Join the Movement

Latin is not just a tool. It‚Äôs a new way to think about programming. A new literacy for the next era of computing.

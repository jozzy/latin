Fantastic — this post and visual flow is a great candidate for showing the power of Latin as a composable, readable agentic language.

From the image and context, the flow likely consists of:

Find Leads → using LinkedIn scraping or a search API
Enrich Profiles → pulling data like email, company info
Personalize Messages → using GPT + offers pulled from Notion
Send Emails → via cold outreach (Saleshandy, Instantly, etc.)
🔁 What This Would Look Like in Latin

UseCase: automated_pipeline

Start when a campaign is launched with target_keywords:

  • @call find_leads with target_keywords → raw_leads

  • @call enrich_profiles with raw_leads → enriched_profiles

  For each lead in enriched_profiles:
    • @call fetch_offer_for_industry with lead.industry → offer_text
    • @call personalize_message with lead and offer_text → email_body
    • @call send_email with lead.email and email_body

  @respond "Campaign executed for ${enriched_profiles.count} leads."

End.
🔧 Example: find_leads.latin

UseCase: find_leads

Start when target_keywords are received:

  • Use PhantomBuster or LinkedIn API to get profiles
  • Return list of leads with name, LinkedIn URL, company, title

  @respond with raw_leads

End.
🔧 Example: enrich_profiles.latin

UseCase: enrich_profiles

Start when raw_leads is received:

  • Use email + domain enrichment tool
  • Add valid email, website, industry, headcount to each lead
  • Filter out incomplete records

  @respond with enriched_profiles
🔧 Example: fetch_offer_for_industry.latin

UseCase: fetch_offer_for_industry

Start when an industry name is received:

  • Query Notion DB for top offer related to the industry
  • @respond with offer_text
🔧 Example: personalize_message.latin

UseCase: personalize_message

Start when lead and offer_text are received:

  • Use GPT-4 to write a message based on:
      - Company name
      - Offer relevance
      - Lead title

  • @respond with email_body
🔧 Example: send_email.latin

UseCase: send_email

Start when recipient and email_body are received:

  • Send email via Saleshandy or SMTP
  • @respond "Email sent to ${recipient}"
🔍 Key Benefits Over n8n

Aspect	n8n Style	Latin Style
🔍 Logic visibility	Hidden in visual nodes	Clean, top-to-bottom text
✏️ Editable by PM/marketer	❌ (needs tool access)	✅ Yes, edit .latin in plain text
🧪 Testable	❌ Hard	✅ Built-in Verify: syntax
🔁 Reusable steps	❌ Copy-paste nodes	✅ Modular @call-able flows
🧠 GPT integration	⛔️ Complex & tool-dependent	✅ First-class language capability
📦 Version control	❌ (export JSON)	✅ Git-native .latin files
🧵 Scalable workflows	❌ Hard to branch/test	✅ Easy routing, fallback, A/B flows
